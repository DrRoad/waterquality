- What is the role of this package?
- Which are the quality metrics supported?
- What is the type of input data are supported?

## Data preparation

- How to prepare the data to be used by `waterquality`?
- Show the whole process, from data download (e.g. landsat), data crop (keeping only the lake), to creation of the final RasterStack

## Single algorithm calculation

- Show an example of using just one algorithm
- Create a map
- Explain the result + mention when it is important

## Multiple algorithm calculation

- Explain how the `wq_calc()` function works
- Give one or two examples of its use

## References

- Put a references to your new paper, but also to the papers that introduced the algorithms used in this vignette

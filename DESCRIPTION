Description: The goal of waterquality to convert satellite-reflectance imagery to a host of pre-defined water quality algorithms 
designed for the detection of cholorophyll-a, blue-green algae (Phycocyanin), and Turbidity. This package is able
to process the following sensor configurations: WorldView-2, Sentinel-2, Landsat-8, MODIS, and MERIS sensors.

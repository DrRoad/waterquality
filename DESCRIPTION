Description: The goal of 'waterquality' is to convert satellite-reflectance imagery
    to a host of pre-defined water quality algorithms designed for the detection of 
    cholorophyll-a, blue-green algae (Phycocyanin), and turbidity. 
    This package is able to process the following sensor configurations: 
    WorldView-2, Sentinel-2, Landsat-8, MODIS, and MERIS.

# waterquality

The goal of **waterquality** is to convert satellite-reflectance imagery to a host of pre-defined water quality algorithms designed for the detection of cholorophyll-a, blue-green algae (Phycocyanin), and Turbidity. 
This package is able to process the following sensor configurations: WorldView-2, Sentinel-2, Landsat-8, MODIS, MERIS, and OLCI.

## Installation

You can install the released version from CRAN with:

```{r install_CRAN, eval = FALSE}
install.packages("waterquality")
```

You can install waterquality from github with:

```{r gh-installation, eval = FALSE}
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("RAJohansen/waterquality")
```

## Example

The main function in this package is `wq_calc()`:

```{r example, fig.asp=0.33}
library(waterquality)
library(raster)
s2 = stack(system.file("raster/S2_Harsha.tif", package = "waterquality"))
s2_two_alg = wq_calc(s2, alg = c("TurbChip09NIROverGreen", "Be16FLHGreenRedNIR"), sat = "sentinel2")
plot(s2_two_alg)
```

## Package Contributions

We encourage users to submit issues and enhancement requests so we may continue to improve our package. 

Futhermore, if you have a water quality algorithm that was not on our list, and you would like for it to be included in our package please email me at richard.a.johansen@erdc.dren.mil
